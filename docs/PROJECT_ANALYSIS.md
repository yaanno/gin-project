#### 1.4 Brute Force Protection
```go
type LoginAttemptTracker struct {
    attempts     map[string]int
    lockDuration time.Duration
    mu           sync.RWMutex
}

func (lat *LoginAttemptTracker) RecordFailedAttempt(ip string) bool {
    lat.mu.Lock()
    defer lat.mu.Unlock()
    
    lat.attempts[ip]++
    return lat.attempts[ip] > MAX_ATTEMPTS
}
```
